    "\n",
    "Now that you have learned about CSV and JSON file formats individually, it's time to bring them together with a cumulative lab! Even as a junior data scientist, you can often produce novel, interesting analyses by combining multiple datasets that haven't been combined before.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Practice reading serialized JSON and CSV data from files into Python objects\n",
    "* Practice extracting information from nested data structures\n",
    "* Practice cleaning data (filtering, normalizing locations, converting types)\n",
    "* Combine data from multiple sources into a single data structure\n",
    "* Interpret descriptive statistics and data visualizations to present your findings\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we move to looking at the relationship between wins and population, it's useful to understand the distribution of wins alone. A few notes of interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of wins is skewed and looks like a [negative binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution), which makes sense conceptually\n",
    "* The \"typical\" value here is 1 (both the median and the highest point of the histogram), meaning a typical team that qualifies for the World Cup wins once\n",
    "* There are a few teams we might consider outliers: Belgium and France, with 6x the wins of the \"typical\" team and 1.5x the wins of the next \"runner-up\" (Uruguay, with 4 wins)\n",
    "* This is a fairly small dataset, something that becomes more noticeable with such a \"spiky\" (not smooth) histogram\n"
